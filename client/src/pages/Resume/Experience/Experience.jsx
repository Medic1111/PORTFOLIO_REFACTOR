          Event's company, demonstrating end-to-end ownership from initial
          planning to final product delivery. Transformed UI designs into HTML
          templates for email campaigns, seamlessly converting CSV guest lists

          previous 10-15 minute delay experienced with mainstream solutions,

          - Backend Developer: Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills
          during Voyage 41 by stepping in to assist a team in dire need after
          their backend developer had to depart unexpectedly. With limited time
          remaining to deliver their minimum viable product (MVP), the team
          faced a non-functional API built on an unfamiliar tech stack. Taking
          swift action, I designed and deployed an intuitive E-commerce API,
          enabling them to successfully complete and deliver their project
          within the deadline. My efforts were recognized with a certification
          of completion that reflected the entire six-week duration of the
          voyage.

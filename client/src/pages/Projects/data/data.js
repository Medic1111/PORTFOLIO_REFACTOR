      "Introducing a minimalist E-commerce platform designed specifically for enthusiasts of wall and street art. This user-friendly platform offers a delightful interface and engaging user experience. Registered users can manage their shopping carts and securely complete transactions using credit cards. The platform also boasts convenient email notifications, order confirmations, and a real-time chat feature for prompt customer support.",
    tech: `The developed software is a full stack application leveraging a modern technology stack including React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Vanilla CSS. To facilitate secure online payments, the Stripe API has been integrated into the platform. The authentication and authorization system has been meticulously crafted from scratch. To ensure robust security measures are in place, the application is guarding against XSS attacks, NoSQL script injection, and brute force attacks, while prioritizing data sanitization. Real-time chat functionality has been achieved through the utilization of Socket.io, enabling seamless communication between users and employees. The application incorporates automatic email notifications for various events such as user registration, purchases, and customer service interactions. Additionally, a scheduled cron task has been implemented to automatically empty inactive shopping carts every 24 hours and streamline the restocking process of products. To efficiently manage client-side state, Redux in conjunction with React-Redux and Redux Toolkit has been employed. The software's design embraces a clean and bold aesthetic, complemented by captivating animations from the React Awesome Reveal library. Horizontal scrolling has been implemented to provide users with a unique browsing experience. One notable feature is the dynamic product list, which automatically updates on a monthly basis. It showcases components such as the "current expo," "previous expo," and "spoiler," providing visitors with a glimpse into the latest offerings. This meticulously developed software solution offers an immersive, secure, and visually captivating experience for art enthusiasts, catering to their diverse needs in the world of e-commerce.`,

While the project is functional and publicly accessible, it is important to mention that there are known bugs and issues that are actively being addressed. My current focus is on testing and actively working on bug reporting and fixing to improve the project's stability and user experience. As this is a side-project and I have limited dedicated time available, I am working diligently to address these issues within the constraints of my schedule. I believe in openness and continuous improvement, and I am committed to resolving the bugs and enhancing the project further.
